⚠️ Important — Render Keep-alive / Redeploy Behavior
The backend is hosted on Render, which may shut down or redeploy after periods of inactivity. This can make the backend temporarily unavailable.
Tip: Open (refresh) the backend link every 15 minutes during use or demos to keep it active and avoid delays.
If you face any issue, simply refresh the backend link above.
